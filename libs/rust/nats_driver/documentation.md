Sure thing! Here's a documentation draft for your `NatsClient` code. Feel free to adjust it to better fit your project's
style or additional details you'd like to include.

# `NatsClient` Documentation

The `NatsClient` provides a simplified interface for interacting with NATS, a lightweight and high-performance messaging
system for cloud-native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures. It encapsulates the process of
connecting to a NATS server, subscribing to topics, and accessing subscriber objects.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the `async_nats` crate for its underlying NATS functionality. Ensure that `async_nats` is included
in your project's dependencies.

## Enums

### `NatsDriverError`

Enumerates possible errors that `NatsClient` can encounter during its operations:

- `SubscribeError(SubscribeError)`: Wraps errors that occur while trying to subscribe to a subject.
- `NoSubscriber`: Indicates that there is no subscriber present when an attempt is made to access one.
- `ConnectionError(ConnectError)`: Wraps errors that occur during the connection to a NATS server.

## Structs

### `NatsClient`

The main structure provided by this module for interacting with NATS.

#### Fields

- `client: Client`: Represents a client connection to a NATS server.
- `subscription: Option<Subscriber>`: Optionally holds a `Subscriber` instance if a subscription has been made.

#### Methods

- `async fn new(url: &str) -> Self`: Asynchronously creates a new `NatsClient` instance and connects it to the specified
  NATS server.

    - **Parameters**:
        - `url: &str`: The URL of the NATS server to connect to.

    - **Returns**: A new instance of `NatsClient`.

- `async fn subscribe(&mut self, subject: &str) -> Result<(), NatsDriverError>`: Asynchronously subscribes the client to
  a specified subject.

    - **Parameters**:
        - `subject: &str`: The subject to subscribe to.

    - **Returns**: `Ok(())` on successful subscription, or `Err(NatsDriverError)` if an error occurs.

- `fn get_subscriber(&self) -> Result<&Subscriber, NatsDriverError>`: Retrieves the current subscriber, if any.

    - **Returns**: A reference to the `Subscriber` if present, or `Err(NatsDriverError::NoSubscriber)` if not.

## Usage Example

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut nats_client = NatsClient::new("nats://localhost:4222").await;
    match nats_client.subscribe("my_subject").await {
        Ok(_) => println!("Successfully subscribed to my_subject."),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to subscribe: {:?}", e),
    }

    match nats_client.get_subscriber() {
        Ok(subscriber) => {
            // Use the subscriber for message handling
        }
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to get subscriber: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

## Note

This module is asynchronous and requires an async runtime, like `tokio`, to function properly.
