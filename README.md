**Here's a file structure for a monorepo suitable for multiple programming languages and microservices:**

**Root Directory:**

- `apps/`: Contains code for individual microservices, grouped by language or service domain.
  - `go/`: Go microservices
  - `python/`: Python microservices
  - `node/`: Node.js microservices
  - `.../`: Other language-specific directories as needed
- `libs/`: Shared libraries and modules, organized by language or functionality.
  - `common/`: Common code across languages (e.g., configuration, interfaces)
  - `go/`: Go libraries
  - `python/`: Python libraries
  - `node/`: Node.js libraries
  - `.../`: Other language-specific libraries
- `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure-related code (deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfiles)
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for development and operations
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project and its components
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and directories to exclude from version control
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `Makefile` (optional): Automates common tasks

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Language-Specific Grouping:** Consider grouping microservices by language for easier management and tooling.
- **Separate `apps` and `libs`:** This distinction promotes modularity and reusability.
- **Common Code:** Place common code in `libs/common` for sharing across languages.
- **Infrastructure:** Keep infrastructure-related code separate for clarity and maintainability.
- **Version Control:** Use a version control system like Git to track changes and enable collaboration.
- **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation for the project and its components.
- **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for microservices and libraries.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── go/
│   │   ├── service1/
│   │   └── service2/
│   ├── python/
│   │   └── service3/
│   └── node/
│       └── service4/
├── libs/
│   ├── common/
│   │   └── config/
│   ├── go/
│   │   ├── database/
│   │   └── logging/

│       └── utils/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── deployment/
│   └── cicd/
├── scripts/
│   ├── build.sh
│   └── deploy.sh
├── docs/
│   └── architecture.md
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── Makefile
```

This structure provides a solid foundation for organizing your monorepo with multiple languages and microservices, fostering maintainability, collaboration, and efficient development workflows.

## How to add new go package example:

```
go mod init -C ./pkg/alpha github.com/mitchallen/go-monorepo-demo/pkg/alpha
go work use -r .
go mod tidy -C ./pkg/alpha/
```
